                    <p class="content001">Anti-termite treatment is a specialized pest control service designed to prevent or eliminate termite infestations. This process involves using specific chemicals that do not kill termites immediately. Instead, these chemicals allow termites to carry the toxins back to their nests, effectively spreading the poison throughout the entire colony and creating a domino effect that leads to the eradication of the infestation.Thus, a chemical barrier is created in and around the affected areas.</p>

                    <p class="content000">About Termites:</p>
                    <p class="content001">Termites are white coloured small soft insects that are usually less than a half-inch length and lives in colonies. Moisture is the main reason for infestation of the termites because termites attract to damp environments. Some of the reasons for the infestation are poor quality of construction, improper plumbing and drainage systems in the modern day buildings, lack of proper ventilation in the rooms, erecting furniture adjacent to bathrooms etc. </p>

                    <p class="content000">How Termites Grow</p>
                    <p class="content001">The sudden termite sightings can be very alarming. It is due to the occurrence of termite swarms or in other words termiteâ€™s reproductive system. Through swarming, termites reproduce winged termites known as swammers. Swarming happens due to warm temperatures, high humidity, darkness and other environmental reasons. These swammers fly to other places, shed their wings and make new colonies when they get favourable conditions to breed. These sets of insects will then later become the king or queen termites of their colonies which they have newly established.</p>

The location of the termite nest is identified and then a drill is used to expose the nest. Next the hole created is injected with the termiticide. Any wooden peice of furniture affected is also treated with termiticide. This modus operandi completely eradicates termites in the area. Post Contruction ATT has a gaurantee of upto 5 years. It is pertinent to mention that the post construction ATT can also be taken up as a preventive measure for safeguarding the future infestations.</p>

                    <p class="content001">Coakroaches are resilient creature, and hence they do not show much result to General Disinfestation once the area is infestated with them. So to eradicate cockroaches, a special treatment process must be followed. It involves careful inspection (locating entry points, removing food and shelter for cockroaches) followed by targeted application of gel bait and a subsequent General Disinfestation with effective insecticides. In respect of microwaves. Refrigerator, mixy, gas stove, aquaguard etc., gel bait is the only remedial solution for eradicating cockroaches. For an effective cockroach-free atmosphere, a quarterly preventive cockroach treatment is advisable. 
                        However, in respect of Hospitability industries like hotels, restaurants, hospitals etc.fortnightly thorough cleaning, subsequently followed by anti-cockroach treatment is needed for proper cockroach-free atmosphere.

                        <p class="content001">Mosquitoes can only be effectively controlled if the breeding areas are identified and those areas are treated with larvicidal medicines. Besides, accumulation of stagnant water should be checked, due care should be exercised to keep the drainage system well maintained and also, keeping the surroundings clean. In Indian atmosphere, thickly populated cities with open nullahs and unhygienic surroundings create major pastures for the breeding of the mosquitoes.
                            Mosquito control involves the treating of still water bodies with larvicide. For outdoor areas, proper sprinkling of insecticides targeting the hiding places of the mosquitoes will give maximum results. This is executed through hot/cold fogging followed by GD. While for indoor, a simple GD is sufficient, if the mosquito menace is controllable. However, specialized wall to wall non-toxic and eco-friendly spray will provide a long-lasting result for mosquito control.   This specialised treatment decimates the mosquito population and minimizes the risk of mosquito-borne diseases and improves quality of life. 
                            It is pertinent to mention that controlling mosquitoes are possible but eradication is near to impossible.

                    <p class="content000">About Bed Bugs:</p>
                        <p class="content001">It is a wingless small reddish brown bloodsucking bug which are infesting houses and especially beds and feeding on human blood. It is of the size of an apple seed. Bed bugs are external parasites and propagate through reproduction. They are often introduced into a new environment via infested items such as luggage, furniture and clothing. They hide in headboards, bed frames and other objects around a bed and come out at night to feed on their preferred host, human. Bed bugs can also migrate between adjacent apartments or hotel rooms. A female bed bug typically lay an average of one egg per day, although they can lay as many as 5-7 eggs in a single day at their peak.  It takes only 10-15 days for an egg to hatch. A bed bug is able to reproduce about 6 weeks after hatching. Most bed bugs live approximately 4 to 6 months. </p>

                    <p class="content001">The most common health issue is related to itching that often comes along with bed bug bites. Many people experience red bumps or welts on their skin within a couple of days of a bed bug attack. These bites can itch incessantly and scratching is inevitable. Excessive scratching causes damage to the skin which turns into dangerous infections. </p>
